Hello everyone!

Welcome to the junior frontend developer survival guide.
I decided to create this guide, when I looked back to myself and started my first job.
I knew some html,css and javascript, but was feeling a bit lost with the architecture of a modern web application and all the tools professional developers use. Git, Webpack, npm, node, babel, yarn, typescript, flow, config files, task runners, tons of libraries and frameworks, web manifests, APIs, intergrations, linters, json, yaml, docker, development servers, hot module reloading what are all these? Don't be scared!

And apart from that, how do I move into building a modern web application?

I will try to make the guide as simple as possible, assuming you know nothing than html, css and a bit of javascript. 

But beware! This guide will not teach you html, css and javascript. 
I would also assume that you can use an editor of your choice (personally, I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) and you can navigate between folders using the terminal.

Also, I recommend reading [this short article on how a website works](https://www.codeschool.com/beginners-guide-to-web-development/how-does-a-website-work)
and become familiar with a basic use of the browser console. [Here](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/) is a guide on Chrome's console, but it's up to you which browser you choose.

## But, how do I know that I know HTML, CSS and Javascript?

Well, unfortunately, you never know what you don't know! But I recommend feeling comfortable with the following before you continue with this guide.

### HTML

* I can use [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) as a reference and I can create a basic html page.
* I understand the importance of [HTML Semantics](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp).
* I have read and I follow the [HTML Style Guide](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_syntax.asp)

### CSS

* I can use [e3c css reference](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp).
* I am familiar with the box model.
* I know the difference between ```position: absolute;``` and ```position: relative```.
* I understand CSS specificity.

### Javascript

* I am comfortable with if statements, for loops and defining variables.
* I can add event listeners and respond to them.
* I know how scope works and why it is important not to pollute the global namespace.
* I know the difference between javascript primitives and javascript objects.
* I know the difference between `==` and `===`. I know the difference between false and falsy, true and truthy.
* I understand hoisting and the difference between function declaration vs function expression.
* I understand prototype inheritance and object composition.
* I understand `this`.
