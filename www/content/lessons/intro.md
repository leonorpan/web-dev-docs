Hello everyone!

Welcome to the junior frontend developer survival guide.
I decided to create this guide, when I looked back to myself and started my first job.
I knew some html,css and javascript, but was feeling a bit lost with the architecture of a modern web application. Git,Webpack, npm, node, babel, yarn, typescript, flow, config files, task runners, tons of libraries and frameworks, web manifests, APIs, intergrations, linters, json, yaml, docker, development servers, hot module reloading what are all these? Don't be scared!

And apart from that, how do I move into building a modern web application?
All you need is html, css and javascript, why did I feel stuck?

This is a guide to explain everything that I personally foind confusing a few years ago, so you don't feel confused, or at least- you wrap all those things together faster than I did.

I will try to make the guide as simple as possible, assuming you know nothing than html, css and javascript. 

But beware! This guide will not teach you html, css and javascript. 

Make sure you have already covered those. There are great resources out there that can help you with that.

## But, how do I know that I know those?

Well, unfortunately, you never know what you don't know! But I recommend knowing the following before you continue with this guide.

### HTML

* I can make a basic html page with a header, footer and a main section.
* I can make an html form properly.
* I can add an image from a local folder or a url.
* I can make an html table.
* I know the importance of semantic html.
* I can use w3schools as a reference.

### CSS

* I know how to import a css file into an html document.
* I know the difference between inline and block elements.
* I know the box model.
* I can use media queries.

### Javascript

* I know about if statements, for loops and defining variables
* I know about scope and why it is important
* I understand global objects (window).

I would also assume that you can use an editor of your choice (personally, I use VSCode) and you can navigate between folders in the terminal. 

If you are not confused with the above, amazing! Let's continue!
If you are feeling overwhelmed, don't worry, you still need to practice a bit more!
This is just a recommendation, it's up to you if you want to try this guide, what you need to know is that no matter what, you are super welcome!
