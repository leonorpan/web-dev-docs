# Let's start from scratch!

This is the html I added for my web app. Feel free to write your own and play around!

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">    
    <title>Hello page</title>    
</head>

<body>
    <header>
        <a href="#" class="home">Home</a>
    </header>

    <main>
        <div class="content">
            <h1>Hello world! </h1>
            <h2>This is a very simple page for now...</h2>
        </div>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <div>Build with ðŸ’œ by me</div>
    </footer>
</body>

</html>
```

ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ Right click on your index.html and open it with your favorite browser ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰

That's good for now but ugly, right? In the next lesson, we will add the css to make it pretty!

## Tips
* Use an [html validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to make sure your html has no errors.


## Notes

* ```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
```
is optional, but will make your web app responsive.
