# The simplest possible web app

We are going to start by developing the simplest web page ever made.
The only thing you need is an html and a css file and optionally, a javascript file.

### Create a new directory and navigate into it

```
$ mkdir simple-app-step-1
$ cd simple-app-step-1
```

### Create the html, css and javascript files

``` 
$ touch index.html
$ touch index.css
$ touch index.js
```

This is how the structure of your directory should look like:

```
simple-app-step-1/
  index.css
  index.html
  index.js  
```

Nice! We have a directory with everything we need! We are ready to go!
