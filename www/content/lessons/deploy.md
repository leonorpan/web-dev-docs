title: "Deploying our app"
---

## Recap

In the previous section, we create a simple structure of our app.
This includes

* index.html
* index.css
* index.js

You will find the complete code of the first chapter [here](https://github.com/leonorpan/web-dev-docs/tree/master/examples/simple-app-step-1)

## Deploying

There are several ways to deploy your app. In this example, we will use [now](https://zeit.co/now) , which is one of my favorites.
The main reason that I use now in this lesson, is that you don't need a git repository to deploy your app.

We will talk about git later on.

The deploy is super simple

* Download [now](https://zeit.co/download).
* Open the app and follow the registration steps.

On your project root run

```
$ now
```

Now will deploy the app and give you a URL.
